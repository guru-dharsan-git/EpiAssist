       "\"## Laboratory Confirmation Methods and Disease Diagnosis Through Blood Glucose Measurements\\n\\nThe primary laboratory confirmation method for Chikungunya infection involves serological tests (such as IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on clinical specimens, such as serum or blood. These methods aim to detect the presence of antibodies against the Chikungunya virus or viral RNA in the patient's sample.\\n\\nIn contrast, diabetes diagnosis primarily involves measuring blood glucose levels using various techniques, including:\\n\\n- HbA1c test: Assesses average blood glucose control over the preceding 2â€“3 months by examining the percentage of hemoglobin that has been glycated.\\n- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose tests during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): These measures assess the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels after consuming a meal.\\n\\nTG Booklet 6, paragraph 166 clarifies that for diabetes diagnosis, blood glucose measurements are utilized.\""
